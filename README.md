# SMILEI Framework
This project holds sample scenes, along with the SMILEI Core and plugins checked out as [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). 
It is intended for use during development of the framework.
If you want to use SMILEI as an end user, you should check out the submodules individually using the [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-git.html).
