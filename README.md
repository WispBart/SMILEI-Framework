# SMILEI Framework
This project holds sample scenes, along with the SMILEI Core and plugins checked out as git submodules. 
It is intended for use during development of the framework.
If you want to use SMILEI as an end user, you should check out the submodules individually using the [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-git.html).
